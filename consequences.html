  <h2>Interpretive AI Advisory</h2>

  <h3>Consequences</h3>
  <p><em>When Interpretive Authority Becomes Unavoidable</em></p>

  <p>
    AI-mediated systems increasingly participate in the formation, circulation, and repetition of meaning across institutional, technical, and public environments. In many cases, this mediation remains provisional and open to revision.
  </p>

  <p>
    There are, however, identifiable conditions under which interpretation ceases to be adjustable and begins instead to function as infrastructure. Interpretive authority becomes required not because clarity is desirable, but because reliance has already begun.
  </p>

  <h3>Reliance and Propagation</h3>

  <p>
    Interpretive authority becomes unavoidable when AI-mediated representations are acted upon before their meaning has been consciously examined. This may occur when summaries inform decisions, when classifications shape access or exclusion, or when model-generated representations are incorporated into institutional processes.
  </p>

  <p>
    Once action is taken on the basis of those representations, interpretation is no longer speculative. It has already shaped outcome.
  </p>

  <p>
    AI systems do not produce isolated outputs. They generate representations that may be repeated, quoted, indexed, or relied upon in downstream environments. Where such propagation is likely — particularly in regulatory, financial, public, or institutional contexts — ambiguity does not dissipate through circulation. It stabilises through repetition. Interpretation becomes cumulative rather than local.
  </p>

  <h3>Institutional Language and Stabilised Ambiguity</h3>

  <p>
    Regulatory guidance, corporate statements, policy documents, and public communications increasingly encounter automated summarisation, classification, and extraction. Where language is likely to be ingested and operationalised by AI systems, unresolved ambiguity may be transformed into stable representation without conscious adjudication.
  </p>

  <p>
    Not all ambiguity is harmful. Many systems function with tolerance for interpretive openness. The difficulty arises when ambiguous meaning is repeatedly relied upon and gradually treated as settled. Once repetition creates de facto stability, questions of meaning are no longer theoretical. They influence allocation, access, assessment, and accountability.
  </p>

  <p>
    Interpretive authority becomes unavoidable at the point where ambiguity persists through use and begins to structure action simply by remaining in place.
  </p>

  <h3>Retrospective Correction and Structural Position</h3>

  <p>
    Legal interpretation, policy enforcement, and governance mechanisms typically operate after impact or dispute. Where AI-mediated interpretation has already structured behaviour, retrospective correction may clarify responsibility but cannot undo the stabilisation of meaning that preceded it. In such environments, interpretive judgement is required prior to dispute, not solely after harm.
  </p>

  <p>
    This does not displace engineering, governance, safety, or legal analysis. Each retains its distinct remit. Interpretive authority concerns the prior question: what meaning is being fixed once AI mediation renders interpretation operational and relied upon.
  </p>

  <p>
    Where interpretation shapes action, and action creates consequence, the question of meaning cannot be deferred without effect.
