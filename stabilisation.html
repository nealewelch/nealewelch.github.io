  <h2>Interpretive AI Advisory</h2>

  <h3>Stabilisation</h3>

  <h3>When Meaning Becomes Structurally Settled</h3>

  <p>
    Stabilisation refers to the point at which mediated interpretation ceases to behave as provisional and begins instead to function as a stable point of reference.
  </p>

  <p>
    In AI-mediated environments, language does not remain indefinitely open. As representations circulate, are repeated, and are relied upon across documents, systems, and institutional settings, certain formulations begin to acquire practical durability. They are used not as tentative readings, but as sufficient descriptions.
  </p>

  <p>
    This shift does not require formal amendment, explicit endorsement, or conscious agreement. Meaning may stabilise through use, without requiring formal endorsement. Once a formulation is routinely treated as adequate for decision, reference, or reproduction, it begins to function as settled, even if the originating text remains formally flexible.
  </p>

  <h3>From Movement to Settlement</h3>

  <p>
    Interpretation describes the formation of meaning under mediation. Stabilisation describes a change in how that meaning behaves once formed.
  </p>

  <p>
    While interpretation concerns how language is compressed, restated, or operationalised, stabilisation concerns how those restatements persist. A stabilised formulation may begin to function without continual return to its source. It acquires continuity through repetition and embedded use.
  </p>

  <p>
    At this stage, alternative readings do not disappear, but they lose operational relevance. Meaning becomes practically fixed not because disagreement has ended, but because reliance has begun.
  </p>

  <h3>Stabilisation Without Adjudication</h3>

  <p>
    Stabilisation is distinct from formal determination. Courts adjudicate disputes. Regulators clarify obligations. Governance frameworks specify procedures. These mechanisms operate by declaration or decision.
  </p>

  <p>
    Stabilisation, by contrast, operates through persistence. A particular rendering of language may become the effective reference point without ever having been consciously selected as such. It is sufficient that it is repeatedly used.
  </p>

  <p>
    This distinction matters because stabilisation precedes many forms of retrospective correction. By the time formal review occurs, a formulation may already have shaped action, expectation, and institutional behaviour.
  </p>

  <h3>Structural Persistence</h3>

  <p>
    Once meaning functions as a reference within workflow, documentation, or system output, reversal is rarely clean. Subsequent clarification may adjust interpretation, but it does so against an existing layer of reliance. The prior rendering does not vanish; it is supplemented, contested, or displaced.
  </p>

  <p>
    Stabilisation therefore describes a structural condition rather than a normative judgement. It identifies the point at which interpretation acquires continuity through use and begins to influence outcomes simply by remaining in place.
  </p>

  <p>
    This work addresses that condition descriptively. It does not prescribe which meanings ought to prevail, nor does it direct how institutions should respond. It concerns how meaning behaves once AI mediation renders interpretation durable through repetition and reliance.
