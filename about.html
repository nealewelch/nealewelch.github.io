  <h1>About</h1>

  <p>
    Neale Welch is an independent interpretive advisor.
  </p>

  <p>
    This practice concerns how meaning stabilises and acquires consequence once AI systems mediate language, decisions, and representation.
  </p>

  <p>
    When organisations publish policies, regulatory submissions, public statements, product descriptions, or strategic claims, those materials are increasingly read, summarised, classified, and relied upon by AI systems. Once this mediation occurs, interpretation is no longer merely provisional. It can settle through repetition, adoption, and practical reliance.
  </p>

  <p>
    This work addresses the conditions under which interpretation moves from open guidance toward settled representation. In these situations, model-generated outputs may begin shaping decisions, regulatory positions, reputations, governance, or market understanding.
  </p>

  <h3>Practical Focus</h3>

  <p>
    In straightforward terms, this practice examines how language is likely to be interpreted by AI systems and what follows once that interpretation is relied upon.
  </p>

  <p>
    This may include:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Reviewing claims, definitions, or positioning to assess how models are likely to resolve them</li>
    <li>Identifying where ambiguity may collapse into unintended meanings</li>
    <li>Clarifying interpretive boundaries before publication</li>
    <li>Examining how existing AI-mediated representations are influencing perception or decision-making</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    The work is concerned with interpretive resolution. It does not aim to optimise performance, improve marketing outcomes, or redesign systems. Its focus is how meaning settles and what that settlement implies once reliance begins.
  </p>

  <h3>Scope</h3>

  <p>
    This practice does not operate within AI safety, governance, compliance, technical system development, or enforcement. Those domains are concerned with shaping behaviour, guiding system use, or establishing rules.
  </p>

  <p>
    This work is concerned with how language is interpreted once systems have already mediated it, and how that interpretation settles through reliance.     The subject is meaning as resolved through AI mediation, rather than oversight of the systems themselves.
  </p>

  <h3>Context</h3>

  <p>
    In parallel, Neale Welch has contributed to the development of formal interpretive standards relating to AI-mediated systems and environments. This advisory practice is distinct and engagement-based, but informed by the same attention to boundary conditions and stabilisation.
