  <h2>Interpretive AI Advisory</h2>

  <h3>Interpretive Authority Boundary Matrix</h3>

  <h3>Purpose and Framing</h3>


    <p>
      AI systems increasingly mediate how meaning is formed, stabilised, and relied upon across technical,
      institutional, and social environments. As this mediation becomes routine, interpretations that were
      once provisional begin to function as settled reference points, acted upon, repeated, and embedded
      in downstream processes.
    </p>

    <p>
      In these conditions, questions arise that are no longer fully addressed by optimisation, governance,
      policy, ethics, or system design alone. This is not because those domains are insufficient in general,
      but because each operates with assumptions about meaning that cease to hold once interpretation
      itself becomes operational.
    </p>

    <p>
      The artefact presented here exists to make that structural distinction legible.
    </p>

    <p>
      It does not evaluate outcomes, assign responsibility, prescribe action, or propose a new standard.
      It distinguishes domains of work by examining whether they are structurally capable of resolving questions of meaning as they stabilise through reliance, rather than adjudicating disputes about meaning after the fact.
    </p>

    <p>
      The matrix should be read as a descriptive separation of remit rather than a hierarchy of authority.
      Its purpose is to clarify where interpretive judgement becomes unavoidable, not as a requirement
      imposed externally, but as a consequence of how reliance on AI-mediated meaning now functions in practice.
    </p>

          <td class="yes">Yes</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>

    <h3>What This Boundary Establishes</h3>

    <p>
      Once AI-mediated meaning is acted upon, relied upon, or repeated, it ceases to behave like a
      provisional output and begins to function as infrastructure. Interpretation does not disappear
      at that point; it becomes concentrated, as adjacent functions continue to operate on the assumption
      that meaning has already been settled.
    </p>

    <p>
      Engineering, governance, legal analysis, and policy enforcement remain active, but each of these
      domains presupposes that interpretation has already occurred. None of them is structurally equipped
      to determine what meaning should be once reliance has begun without defaulting to retrospective
      correction, dispute resolution, or enforcement after the fact.
    </p>

    <p>
      The purpose of this boundary is to make that transition legible. It does not prescribe outcomes,
      allocate liability, or displace existing forms of judgment. It exists to clarify the point at which
      interpretation can no longer be deferred without consequence, and where human judgment becomes
      unavoidable because meaning is already shaping action through persistence and reliance.
