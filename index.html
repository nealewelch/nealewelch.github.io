    <h3>About the Advisory</h3>

    <p>
      Neale Welch provides independent interpretive advisory on AI-mediated systems and environments.
      His work concerns how meaning is formed, stabilised, and relied upon once AI systems mediate
      language, decisions, and public understanding.
    </p>

    <p>
      This work centres on interpretive judgement at moments where ambiguity, representation, or
      intent may become binding. This includes examining how AI systems are likely to resolve meaning,
      where interpretive risk arises once mediation occurs, and how particular framings or claims
      propagate downstream after adoption by models, institutions, or markets.
    </p>

    <p>
      The focus is on points at which interpretation acquires consequence. It addresses how meaning is
      effectively fixed once AI-mediated representations are treated as authoritative, regardless of
      original intent.
    </p>

    <h3>Interpretation as Infrastructure</h3>

    <p>
      As AI systems increasingly mediate language, decisions, and public understanding, interpretation
      ceases to be provisional. Meaning does not remain open-ended once models are required to act,
      summarise, classify, or decide.
    </p>

    <p>
      In these conditions, interpretation becomes infrastructure. It shapes outcomes long after
      original intent has faded, and it persists through repetition, delegation, and reliance.
    </p>

    <p>
      This work exists because that interpretive layer now has consequence, whether or not it is
      acknowledged, named, or intentionally designed for.
    </p>

    <h3>Scope and Limits</h3>

    <p>
      This work does not assess whether outcomes are ethical, fair, compliant, or desirable. It is
      concerned solely with how meaning is resolved and relied upon once AI mediation occurs.
    </p>

    <p>
      The work is analytical and judgement-based rather than implementational. It does not involve
      system building, optimisation, delivery, certification, or enforcement. It is provided for
      informational purposes rather than as professional, legal, or technical advice.
    </p>

    <p>
      The work examines conditions under which meaning becomes consequential; it does not direct,
      determine, or prescribe decisions taken on the basis of that meaning.
    </p>
