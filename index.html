    <h2>Interpretive AI Advisory</h2>

    <h3 id="about">About the Advisory</h3>

    <p>
      Neale Welch provides independent interpretive advisory on AI-mediated systems and environments.
      His work concerns how meaning is formed, stabilised, and relied upon once AI systems mediate
      language, decisions, and public understanding.
    </p>

    <p>
      This work centres on interpretive judgement at moments where ambiguity, representation, or intent
      may become binding. This includes examining how AI systems are likely to resolve meaning, where
      interpretive risk arises once mediation occurs, and how particular framings or claims propagate
      downstream after adoption by models, institutions, or markets.
    </p>

    <p>
      The decisive shift occurs when interpretation ceases to be optional and instead becomes operational
      — when AI-mediated representations are acted upon, relied upon, or repeated as if settled.
    </p>

    <p id="consequences">
      The focus is on points at which interpretation acquires consequence. It addresses how meaning is
      effectively fixed once AI-mediated representations are treated as authoritative, regardless of
      original intent.
    </p>

    <h3 id="interpretation">Interpretation as Infrastructure</h3>

    <p>
      As AI systems increasingly mediate language, decisions, and public understanding, interpretation
      ceases to be provisional. Meaning does not remain open-ended once models are required to act,
      summarise, classify, or decide.
    </p>

    <p id="stabilisation">
      In these conditions, interpretation becomes infrastructure. It shapes outcomes long after original
      intent has faded, and it persists through repetition, delegation, and reliance.
    </p>

    <p>
      This work exists because that interpretive layer now has consequence, whether or not it is
      acknowledged, named, or intentionally designed for.
    </p>
    
<p>
  To clarify where this shift occurs, and how it re-routes questions of meaning once AI-mediated interpretation becomes relied upon, the following boundary articulation sets out where interpretive judgement concentrates as meaning stabilises through use.

  <h3 id="hardening">When Interpretation Hardens</h3>

  <p>
    In AI-mediated systems, interpretation does not remain a matter of ongoing adjustment.
  </p>

  <p>
    Once meanings begin to circulate through models, institutions, and repeated use, they acquire a practical stability of their own. They are relied upon not because they are necessarily correct, but because they are already present.
  </p>

  <p>
    At that point, clarity stops being optional. Not as a requirement imposed from outside, but as a consequence of how reliance works. What remains ambiguous can no longer be treated as harmless once it is being acted upon.
  </p>

  <p>
    Demand does not arise from a desire for certainty. It arises when people recognise that interpretation has already started to function as infrastructure, and that what is left unexamined will continue to shape outcomes simply by persisting.
  </p>

    <h3 id="limits">Scope and Limits</h3>

    <p>
      This work does not assess whether outcomes are ethical, fair, compliant, or desirable. It is
      concerned solely with how meaning is resolved and relied upon once AI mediation occurs.
    </p>

    <p>
      The work is analytical and judgement-based rather than implementational. It does not involve
      system building, optimisation, delivery, certification, or enforcement. It is provided for
      informational purposes rather than as professional, legal, or technical advice.
    </p>

    <p>
      The work examines conditions under which meaning becomes consequential; it does not direct,
      determine, or prescribe decisions taken on the basis of that meaning.
