  <h2>Interpretive AI Advisory</h2>

  <h3>Interpretation</h3>
  <p><em>Interpretive Formation Under AI Mediation</em></p>

  <p>
    Interpretation, in this context, concerns the formation and stabilisation of meaning once AI systems participate in the circulation, summarisation, classification, indexing, or repetition of language across institutional and public environments.
  </p>

  <p>
    Regulatory, corporate, and policy texts frequently contain evaluative flexibility. Terms such as proportionate, appropriate, effective, or reasonable allow judgement to develop through supervision, clarification, and contextual application over time.
  </p>

  <p>
    When AI systems summarise, extract, or categorise such material, they compress evaluative space into portable formulations. These formulations may then be quoted, reused, embedded in policies, relied upon in procurement processes, or incorporated into automated workflows. The interpretive question here is not confined to what the text was intended to mean. It concerns what meaning is beginning to function operationally once mediated representations are relied upon.
  </p>

  <p>________________________________________</p>

  <h3>Mechanisms of Settlement</h3>

  <p>
    A summarised clause may omit qualifiers in order to produce a concise description. A classification label may reduce a conditional requirement into a categorical tag. An example intended as illustrative may be restated in secondary material as if it were definitive.
  </p>

  <p>
    These compressed forms circulate because they are easier to reference. AI mediation increases the speed, scale, and cross-context portability of these compressed formulations, allowing them to propagate across documents, systems, and decision environments without direct re-engagement with the originating text. Over time, repeated citation of the compressed version may become the practical point of reference within an organisation, even though the originating document retains its flexibility. Settlement often occurs through cumulative reliance without formal amendment.
  </p>

  <p>________________________________________</p>

  <h3>Operative Meaning</h3>

  <p>
    An interpretation is being produced where a stabilised formulation is already guiding decisions, shaping internal standards, informing risk assessments, structuring access, or anchoring compliance documentation.
  </p>

  <p>
    The relevant question is not which interpretation could theoretically be defended. It is which formulation is already being acted upon across systems, documents, and processes.
  </p>

  <p>
    Interpretive advisory work examines how that operative meaning is forming, where it is consolidating, and what effects attach to leaving it unexamined.
  </p>

  <p>________________________________________</p>

  <h3>Structural Position</h3>

  <p>
    This work does not determine what the law requires, how a system should be engineered, or how governance frameworks ought to be constructed.
  </p>

  <p>
    It addresses a prior condition: how meaning is settling in practice once AI mediation renders language portable, repeatable, and operational.
  </p>

  <p>
    Where interpretation shapes reliance across systems and processes, it functions as part of institutional structure even if no formal declaration has been made.
