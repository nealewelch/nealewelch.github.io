  <h2>Interpretive AI Advisory</h2>

  <h3>Limits</h3>
  <h3>Engagement Structure</h3>

  <p>
    This advisory work is discrete and engagement-based. It does not operate as an ongoing consultancy, programme, or implementation function. Its focus is confined to the examination of meaning once AI mediation renders interpretation operational and relied upon.
  </p>

  <p>
    The engagement exists to clarify how language is likely to stabilise when subject to automated summarisation, classification, and repetition, and to examine the consequences of that stabilisation before continued reliance begins to treat a particular interpretation as settled.
  </p>


  <h3>Conditions for Engagement</h3>

  <p>
    Engagements arise when language is expected to enter AI-mediated environments in which interpretation may settle through use. This may include policy publication, regulatory submission, strategic positioning, product description, institutional communication, or other materials likely to be summarised, indexed, circulated, or relied upon.
  </p>

  <p>
    The work does not require that harm has occurred. It concerns the conditions under which interpretation may acquire practical stability once mediation begins.
  </p>


  <h3>Materials Examined</h3>

  <p>
    The advisory may involve the examination of:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Public or internal policy documents</li>
    <li>Regulatory filings or guidance</li>
    <li>Strategic or market-facing claims</li>
    <li>Product or service descriptions</li>
    <li>Existing AI-mediated representations in circulation</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    The work concerns how meaning is likely to be resolved once systems have processed the material, and how ambiguity may stabilise through repetition and institutional reliance.
  </p>


  <h3>Mode of Analysis</h3>

  <p>
    The work is analytical and judgement-based. It considers:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Points at which meaning may collapse into unintended fixed interpretations</li>
    <li>Conditions under which ambiguity may cease to be provisional</li>
    <li>How representations are likely to propagate across AI-mediated systems</li>
    <li>Where reliance may produce de facto settlement of meaning</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    The purpose is not to optimise, reframe, or redesign language, but to make interpretive conditions visible where they would otherwise harden without examination.
  </p>


  <h3>What the Engagement Provides</h3>

  <p>
    The engagement provides clarity regarding how language may be interpreted once mediated by AI systems and treated as authoritative through repetition and use.
  </p>

  <p>
    It brings into view:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Where interpretive exposure may arise</li>
    <li>Where stabilisation is likely to occur</li>
    <li>Where continued reliance may give meaning a settled character</li>
    <li>Where boundary clarification may be necessary prior to publication</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    It does not determine outcomes or prescribe decisions. It clarifies conditions under which meaning may become consequential once mediated.
  </p>


  <h3>Deliberate Limits</h3>

  <p>
    This work does not involve:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Technical system development or redesign</li>
    <li>Compliance certification or audit</li>
    <li>Legal determination or liability assessment</li>
    <li>Governance framework implementation</li>
    <li>Performance optimisation or communications strategy</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Engineering, governance, legal, and policy functions retain their distinct roles. This advisory concerns the prior question of interpretive settlement once mediation occurs.
  </p>


  <p>
    The practice is intentionally narrow. It addresses meaning as resolved under AI mediation and the point at which interpretation ceases to be optional because reliance has begun.
